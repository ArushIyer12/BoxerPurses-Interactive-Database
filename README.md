# BoxerPurses-Interactive-Database

This was my final project for CS 217. I built and hosted an interactive database containing information on Boxing Purses on Microsoft Azure

## **Dataset Source**

The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Peter Anderson (via Mendeley Data)](https://www.narcis.nl/dataset/RecordID/oai%3Aeasy.dans.knaw.nl%3Aeasy-dataset%3A131458)

## **Description**

This project is an interactive database containing information on boxing purses. The database is built using a pandas dataframe that was cleaned and prepared by the author. The dataset includes information provided by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) and the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC). The NSAC provided purse information on professional boxing matches in that state from 2009 to 2017. The CSAC provided purse information for the period June 2012 to December 2015.

The SQL folder contains all of the SQL commands used in this project, which were fed to Microsoft Azure Data Studio. The CSVs folder contains the 5 datasets I created from the original data source. The app can be found in the **`app.py`** script. Note that it may take a few tries to connect to the database.
